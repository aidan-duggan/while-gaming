opinion: I can see the appeal, a simple card game but with depth and tension.You have to play better sets of cards or draw a cards, aiming to empty your hand. Theme is pastes on but with high quality.
thoughts: I see can't get my head around trick taking games, the decision space here is more about what you pick up, but picking up is a bad thing. It doesn't help that I did terribly in the 4 rounds I played...
