opinion: A simpler economic train again, auctioning to buy shares in jointly owned rail lines and extending the rail network. Periodic dividends are issues with some randomness. I liked it, boils things down well and didn't suffer the problems I saw with Ride the Rails.
thoughts: The dividend bag and how it pays out is a great mechanic, particularly the ability to alter it by developing cities. For the early turns it really wasn't clear what players should do. Starting an auction had limited benefit if you didn't have the most money, could be a design weakness there in terms of player in last place.
