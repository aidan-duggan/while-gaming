opinion: one of the Pax genre, you play Viking tribe leaders in the 900s exploring, settling and fighting for control of Europe. Classic Pax in being hard to know exactly how you progress and win, ended up with very little fighting for a Viking game! We think the random in game conditions we drew may have contributed to a flat experience.
