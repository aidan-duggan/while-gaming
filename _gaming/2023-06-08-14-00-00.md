opinion: Reminiscent of Terraforming Mars but with an action selection system and Zoo theme. Captures its theme well and has some very interesting systems. The deck of cards is felt too large at 250 leading to a lot of randomness, and dragged a little towards the end. Will see how it fairs with a second play.
thought: The action selection system, and upgrading of it was very engaging. The end game condition where two your tracks cross is intriguing but leads to weird negative scoring.
