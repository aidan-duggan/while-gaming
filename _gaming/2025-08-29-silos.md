opinion: A majority control game about abducting humans and cows. The deck of 12 cards controls what event happens each turn, meaning its about playing the odds more then constructing an explicit plan. Good game greatly elevated by a well executed theme and artwork. Hats!!  The deck where played cards are visible so players don't have to card count is a nice touch, makes the card counting nature obvious and encouraged rather then something only experienced players could do.
