game: Through the Desert
image: images/1000014888.jpg
opinion: A classic Reine Knizia, with 5 players it was madness but I enjoyed the chaos. You are creating lines of camels in the desert to control space. On surface a loose game but a lot of strategy possible.
thoughts: It's basically multi player Go with points salad on top. I wonder what other old games could be remade like this?
