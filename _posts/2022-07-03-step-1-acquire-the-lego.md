To put my plan in motion the first step is to get the pieces! I figured I'd do both ships I found, a smaller one to practice and the large one.

I hit up BrickLink and learned about the wonderful world of buy and selling Lego bricks!

### I know what I need, how do I get it?

Firstly its way more costly then you'd expect. My prior experience on my Lego space fleet was simple pieces and I was able to get everything easily (though still pricey enough) from one place.

This time however the pieces were much rarer and I had to buy from nearly a dozen places to get what I needed. I mistakenly thought I was getting everything from one place till it arrived and I realized my mistake... 

Turns out some of the pieces were only every produced for one Lego set! Eventually after ordering from a dozen places and paying more then I care to admit I got all the pieces I needed (and more somehow...).

Managing piece lists and purchasing was definitely trickier then I expected, something I'll take more care of next time.

### The First Build

Once all the pieces eventually arrived I set about building the smaller ship (the larger would wait till my newborn arrives). 

Step one was to separate out all the pieces. I made this intentionally difficult on myself cause part of the fun for me is digging through a big box of pieces to find the one you need!

Given it came with no instructions, I had a lot of fun just trying to figure it out by looking at it. Starting with the most obvious pieces and working bottom to top. When I got stuck I open the design in Studio and started removing pieces so I could see inside.

After that it wasn't much till it was finished. Now to start the bigger one!
