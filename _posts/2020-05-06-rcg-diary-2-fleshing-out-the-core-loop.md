excerpt: In my last post, I gave a general outline of what I wanted the core
  loop to be. I also created a document on github to start fleshing out my
  rules. Since then I've added much more details to my rules, and added a lot
  more details to what will be the core loop of the game.

**Core Cards**

The game resolves around 2 types of decks, Play cards and Skill cards. In the first iteration, skill cards were for 1 individual skill, and Play cards had a lot of parts to them. I mocked up these designs on some cards to get a feel. Things felt a little too complicated. After much work, I focused on making things simpler as the best way to progress. 

First I looked at the Play cards to see how I could simplify them. I thought about what the core necessary parts were. I reduced the card to minimum needed. 

* Type, run, pass & special. 
* Result table, just big win, win, lose and big lose.
* The number and types (backs/forwards) of players needed.

For the Skill cards, originally each card was just going to have a single skill and value on it. Players would have a hand of these cards to use. In practice though, this seemed to random. Players would have to play whatever they had, without any real choice. Given the simpler Play cards, the Skill cards needed to get more complicated. The skill cards will now represent all the skills for a particular type of player (Back/Forward).
