Its been a long while since I've played games in person with my friends, as is the case for a lot of us. With a new daughter during this whole thing I didn't really prioritize gaming, to focus instead on settling into fatherhood. Now that I'm getting used to things I've started playing boardgames remotely with my friends again.

**In the beginning**

At the start of the pandemic we all picked up the Humble Bundle of boardgames on Steam, and a few times we played those, mostly Carcassone, Splendor and Small World. All are good implementations and I enjoyed playing them but it didn't really generate a desire to set a regular pattern playing. I think this in some way is the problem of limited library and everyone needing a copy of the game.

Recently we've started playing regularly using [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/), this has the advantage of only one person needing to have a paid account and a much wider library of games.

I've been impressed enough with it so far. The library is decent, lots of familiar favourites, as well as lots of weird stuff! Personally I'm trying to only play games I've played physically before (even if only to help make picking a game easier!) but I'll see how long before I crack and play something new to me.

**How I'm finding it**

In terms of the interface. I've played Race for the Galaxy, Alhambra, 7 Wonders, Carcassone and Terra Mystica and I've found all of them very well done. The graphics are basic but your smoothly guided through your turn and their is a clear log of all moves done. In more complex games like Terra Mystica it is easy to miss some options, but for what it is it does the job.

I actually find Carcassone more enjoyable through this interface then the stand alone game on Steam. Something about the less flashy design make it feel closer to the real thing.

**Impression so far**

I've only been playing with friends, which definitely adds to the experience. I played Memoir Online once with randoms and didn't like the pressure I felt to win against people I don't know. I find not having the physical game pieces to hold while playing makes strategizing harder, and removes some of the enjoyment I feel when playing.

Overall though definitely think its works as a replacement until we can all meet up in the real! A very workable interface and enough of a library to keep things interesting. Looking forward to my next session.
