**Quick recap**

I've blogged about my idea for a [Rugby boardgame](posts/idea3). In that post, I discuss the rules of the sport and how they could be mapped to a game. In particular the challenges with how to track 15 players on each side. I then evolved this [idea further](/posts/rugby1), focusing on a variant of the sport called 7s with just 7 players a side. After some more thoughts, I've figured out more how I'd like the game to work, and I'm committing myself to building a working prototype, even if I start to feel its not right.

**Starting a Diary**

To focus myself on moving this idea towards something, I'm going to try running a [boardgame design diary](posts/an-experiement-boardgame-design-diary) for this idea on this blog.  

**Whats changed**

The main challenge I faced was how to reflect the position of the players on the pitch during the game. Rugby is a highly positional sport, where players are standing before play starts plays a big part in how the play progresses. Tracking each player feels very simulation and fiddly, rather then the dyanmic high energy game I'd like. I started to form an idea where multiple players positions would be on a cards, and only some cards would be in play at any time. That way not all players have to be tracked, and these cards can be another resource that players have to manage.
