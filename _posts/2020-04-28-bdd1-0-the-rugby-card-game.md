**Quick recap**

I've blogged about my idea for a [Rugby boardgame](posts/idea3). In that post, I discuss the rules of the sport and how they could be mapped to a game. In particular the challenges with how to track 15 players on each side. I then evolved this [idea further](/posts/rugby1), focusing on a variant of the sport called 7s with just 7 players a side. After some more thoughts, I've figured out more how I'd like the game to work, and I'm committing myself to building a working prototype, even if I start to feel its not right.

**Starting a Diary**

To focus myself on moving this idea towards something, I'm going to try running a [boardgame design diary](posts/an-experiement-boardgame-design-diary) for this idea on this blog.
