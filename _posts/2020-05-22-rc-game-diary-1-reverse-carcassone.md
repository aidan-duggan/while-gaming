Hot of the back of building my first board game prototype, I had an idea for a game. While playing Carcassone online with my friends, I wondered what it would be like to play Carcassone in reverse. Where the tiles were already down and players were picking them up.

**Ideation**

My first idea was a board of tiles where each player takes turn picking one. Each tile would do something, and be worth points at the end. As I thought about this idea, it occurred to me I read about such a game! I remember reading about it in Tabletop Magazine, and after much searching I found it Bumuntu. So not much point trying to make something I already know exists!

I was sweeping the floor of my kitchen one day, and it occurred to me how relaxing and enjoyable it can be to make something clean and neat. In A Theory of Fun.....TODO.
