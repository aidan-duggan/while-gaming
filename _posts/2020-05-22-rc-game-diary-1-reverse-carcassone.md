Hot of the back of building my first board game prototype, I had an idea for another game. While playing Carcassone online with my friends, I wondered what it would be like to play Carcassone in reverse. Where the tiles were already down and players were picking them up.

**Ideation**

My first idea was a board of tiles where each player takes turn picking one up. Each tile would do something, and be worth points at the end. As I thought about this idea, it occurred to me I read about such a game! I remember reading about it in Tabletop Magazine, and after much searching I found it, Bumuntu. While I think there is value in improving an existing game design, I'd like to work on something from the ground first, least I be biased to previous design.

I was sweeping the floor of my kitchen one day, and it occurred to me how relaxing and enjoyable it can be to make something clean and neat. So rather then picking tiles up from a random layout, players would be reorganizing the tiles to neater patterns.

**Rules**

I drafted up a quick set of rules, using carcassone tiles and scoring as the bases. Players would compete over a grid of 81 tiles, taking control of a tile at a time, provided the controlling tiles obeyed carcassone placement rules. 

For terming the actions the play can take, I want to try using the dice action mechanic from Tiny Epic Galaxies. Players roll dice (with some options to reroll), and get to preform those actions. I really like this mechanic as it combine some randomness, some push your luck, with the need that the player actions might fail (roll to success style).

**Next Steps**

Now I just need to do some play testing!
