excerpt: Who knew that buying small pieces of plastic was so hard and so expensive?!

With my plan in motion the first step is to get the pieces! I figured I'd do both ships I found, a smaller one to practice and the large one.

I hit up bricklink and learned about the wonderful world of buy and selling Lego bricks!

Firstly its way more costly then you'd expect. My prior experience on my Lego space fleet was simple pieces and I was able to get everything easily (though still pricey enough).

This time however the pieces were much rarer and I had to buy from nearly a dozen places to get what I needed. 

Turns out some of the pieces were only every produced for one Lego set!

Eventually after ordering from a dozen places and paying more then I care to admit I got all the pieces I needed (and more somehow...).

Managing piece lists and purchasing was definitely trickier then I expected, something I'll take more care of next time.

Title: The first build

Once all the pieces eventually arrived I set about building the smaller ship (the larger would wait till my newborn arrives). 

Given it came with no instructions, I had a lot of fun just trying to figure it out by looking at it. Starting with the most obvious pieces and working bottom to top. When I got stuck I open the design in Studio and started removing pieces so I could see inside.

After that it wasn't much till it was finished. Now to start the bigger one!
