I've been thinking a lot recently about game groups, I've been involved in a few tabletop over many years. In my youth I was not one for sports though, it was only post college where I took up Rugby that I experienced what sports groups are like. I've also observed by father who is big into golf, having captained a club in the past. What follows are my rambling thoughts on board game groups, hopefully I can at some point structure them into something meaningful!

Caveat: all of the below is my experience, and is clearly very local to Dublin, Ireland where I live, a not particularly dense city in a not particularly dense country.

** Tabletop groups I've seen **

I've boardly been involed in 4 types of tabletop gaming groups in 2 decades of playing. 

Wargames is where I started, this would have been pre-college/early college days, groups I got involved with generally just featured regular play in an unstructured manner, with games arranged ad-hoc and generally everyone turning up at a weekly venue (maybe around 6-10 people). Tournaments were where competitive play happened (30+ people), and these were often organized by other organizations. 

Roleplaying games are probably a tangent to my discussion here, as they are more fixed in membership and duration. I think worth touching on briefly though, I've generally played in small (groups 4-6 people) where we would met regularly to play the same game together. I have not experiened any cross group type things, though I do know Pathfinder does have such an organization, that enables some cross group interaction.

Boardgames, I've had the most experience here, taking part in 3-4 different boardgame groups over the last 10 years. I've done both open board game nights at pubs and groups run in someones house. All have had 10+ regular attendees. I've had mixed experiences with open night style, these can be very unstructured where it is more like minded cliques of people just playing their own games in a shared enviroment. I don't mind this as a critisem per se, I've done it myself, but having experienced both sides, it is very intimediateng to arrive at a night with a large group of people who already know each other and are already playing games. My experience of the group that met in someones has was more structured and through that more inviting though I stopped attending eventually.

College Societies, I was deeply invovlved with Trinity Gamers when I was at college, College Gaming societies are a different beast again, they are sort of all 3 groups above in one, with the college year acting as the heartbeat, and the society structure imposed by the college providing a framework for operating.
