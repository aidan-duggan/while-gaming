Its been a long while since I've played games in person with my friends, as is the case for a lot of us. With a new daughter during this whole thing I didn't really prioritize gaming, to focus instead on settling into fatherhood. Now that I'm getting used to things I've started playing boardgames remotely with my friends again.

At the start of the pandemic we all picked up the Humble Bundle of boardgames on steam, and a few times we played those, mostly Carcassone, Splendor and Small World. All are good implementations and I enjoyed playing them but we didn't really get into a regular pattern playing. I think this in some way is the problem of limited library and everyone needing a copy of the game.

Recently we've started playing regularly using Board Game Arena, this has the advantage of only one person needing to have a paid account and a much wider library of games. 

I've been impressed enough with it so far. The library is decent lots of familiar favourites () as well as lots of weird stuff! Personally I'm trying to play games I've played physically before but I'll see how long before I crack and play something new.

In terms of the interface I've played, Race for the Galaxy, Alhambra, 7 Wonders, Carcassone, Terra Mystica and I've found all of them very well done. Your smoothly guided through your turn and their is a clear log of all moves done. In more complex games like Terra Mystica it is easy to miss some things, but for what it is it does the job.

I actually find Carcassone more enjoyable through this interface then the stand alone game on Steam. Something about the less flashy design make it feel closer to the real thing. 

I've only been playing with friends which definitely adds to the experience. I played Memoir Online once with randoms and didn't like the pressure I felt to win against people I don't know. Certainly not having the physical came pieces to hold while playing make strategizing harder, and removes some of the enjoyment I feel when playing. 

Overall though definitely thing its works as a replacement until we can all meet up in the real. A very workable interface and enough of a library to keep things interesting. Looking forward to our next session.
