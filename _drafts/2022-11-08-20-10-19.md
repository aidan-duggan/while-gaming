opinion: I've been writing this blog for a while with a few different tools. I've been trying to find a simple way to blog from my phone while still owning my data. I managed an ok flow with GitHub Pages, Jekyll and Forestry.io but wanted it to be easier. After lots of searching I discovered GitJournal, an Android git app, which seems to give me everything I need! I'll post a full blog post once I've used it a bit more, but very promising so far!
