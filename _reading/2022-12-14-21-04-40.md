opinion: A rightful heir of a medival kingdom has to reach out to his sister who is now an military agent of an alien race for help. A classic Iain M Banks Culture novel. I read it when originally released and didn't rank it highly at the time, a reread hasn't changed that. The themes didn't really resonate when reading. 3.5/5
