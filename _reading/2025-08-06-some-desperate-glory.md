book: Some Desperate Glory
image: images/1000015041.jpg
opinion: A pacey tale of a indoctrinated teenage soldier coming to realize her situation, and dealing with Sci Fi Maguffins at the same time. I can't decide if this was too overt in its messaging and I'm not a huge fan of how it resolves but it was an enjoyable read all the same 3/5
