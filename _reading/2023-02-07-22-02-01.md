opinion: I would sooner describe management as an in-elegant puzzle but this book does a good job of giving a surface level set of tools for succeeding in the role. I would say more applicable in small/medium companies then large established ones. I would recommend to anyone new to managing managers, I think it would be less useful to new to line managers but could help those already experienced who are looking to grow.
