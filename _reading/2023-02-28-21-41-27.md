book: 'One Billion Years to the End of the World - Arkady and Boris Strugatsky'

opinion: A bizarre and surreal novel about a mathematician on the verge of a break through who keeps getting interrupted. Very much a Strugatsky book, I enjoyed reading it but its hard to decide if anything real actually happens in it!
