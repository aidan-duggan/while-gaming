book: Everything they teach you are Harvard Business School

opinion: An autobiography of Philip Broughton's 2 years at HBS. Interesting insight
  to what it is like, also a snapshot in time as it was published early 2008. Generally
  underwhelming, some what saved by the post script reflecting on the 08 financial
  crisis.
published: false
