  I started with just gaming notes, but now with reading and coding notes, this site is developing into a set of micro blogs and one core blog. This has been my plan from the start, as I want to replicate a lot of the positives of short twitter like messages.

  To make the most of this though, I'll need to improve how this site manages them. So next step is to give each micro post a unique link, rather then one running page I have currently.
