opinion: I've been doing a lot of hiring recently, which mainly starts with me looking
  through linkedin. Something I like to see is tenure at a past company, it has been
  my experience that you learn more from your mistakes if you are around longer to
  see them play out. They also help add a diversity of experience to a team. There
  is though a perception that people shouldn't stay more then a couple years at a
  company. I think good companies value long tenured people. So I want to find those
  people and hire them. The problem when hiring though is that people who job hop
  more frequently have more experience interviewing and are more confident about it
  which is an advantage over people with tenured experience. So how to entice and
  interview someone with a deep well of knowledge from their current company when
  they might not have interviewed for many years?
