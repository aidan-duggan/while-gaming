opinion: I've realized an interesting dynamic that has happened in the world of phone
  media. For a long time phone manufacturers have been pushing higher and higher resolution
  camera and video. This is breaking the cloud storage model that says it's easier
  to just give it away for free, given storage is so cheap. Now the likes of Google
  and What's App are aggressively compressing media that is stored to save space.
  They claim there is no loss and offer no alternative but even cursory testing on
  What's App shows different. This is a dark pattern in tech, where they sell high
  resolution cameras, don't actually store that result in the cloud and when you send
  it on they also cut corners. They want to charge you to store more photos but not
  other data cause they know photos are harder to manage, but I wouldn't trust that
  they wouldn't still cut corners for paying customers!
