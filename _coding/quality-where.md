title: Quality where?

opinion: Quality is something every company thrives for. But you can't spend an infinite
  amount of time on quality, only the rare business can manage that. I've been frustrated
  in the past when leadership has said focus on quality but not what to give up for
  it (time, money). This is understandable, teams are best place to make this call,
  but direction helps. So I'm starting a philosophy, when I say quality I'll be explicit
  on where we should focus that. This can be in new stuff, in old stuff, by taking
  longer, by doing less. There are lots of options and for me to lead I have to be
  clear on where we are going to get there.
