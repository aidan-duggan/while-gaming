title: Quality where?

opinion: Quality is something every company thrives for and I've regularly been told
  it's important. But you can't spend an infinite amount of time on quality, only
  the rare business can manage that. It has always sounded weird to me for leadership
  to say quality but not what to give up for it (time, money). Often this is because
  teams are best place to make this call but direction helps, so I'm starting a philosophy,
  when I say quality I'll be explicit on where we should focus that. This can be in
  new stuff, in old stuff, by taking longer, by doing less. There are lots of options
  and for me to lead I have to be clear on where we are going to get there.
