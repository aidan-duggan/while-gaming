opinion: With my Shelley Energy Monitor showing me what I was generating and what was going to grid, I needed a better way yo visualize it. Google Sheets has a great feature called App Script that allows you to write small progams that will run regularly. After getting back into the coding I was able to whip up a small script to pull the data directly from the device using Shelley's cloud api, and with the data on in one sheet it was easy to create a nice graph. Now I can see in one glance what my energy usage is like and start build a full years worth of data.
