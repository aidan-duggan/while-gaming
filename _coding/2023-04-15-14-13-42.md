opinion: I installed solar panels last year and have been enjoying looking at how much electricity I've been generating. Unfortunately because I don't have a battery or car charger my setup didn't easily tell me how much I used internally or was sending back to the grid. So off to the internet I went to find a solution. After much searching I found the Shelly EM, this small device has two clamps you attach to your fuse board and then it wirelessly transmits the data eithe locally or to the cloud. With it I can now see what I generate, use internally and send to the grid. The app perfectly serviceable but doesn't do much for presenting this data well so the next challenge is how to automatically get the data into a spreadsheet for better visualization!
