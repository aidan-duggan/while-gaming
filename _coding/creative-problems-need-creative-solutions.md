opinion: How do you record when your heating goes on and off? You can probably buy
  advanced home heating control systems but what about when you already have a system?
  I can control my heat remotely but its don't track the history of my usage. I did
  a lot of searching, hack the API's for my existing system, try to wire something
  directly to the control board, buy a new system. In the end the simplest and easiest
  solution I found was a wireless temperature alert monitor placed in front of the
  boilers exhaust pipe! A couple days in an it works like a charm, alerts be when
  the heat is on and when it turns off. Now all I have to do is figure out how to
  export the emails to a spreadsheet!
