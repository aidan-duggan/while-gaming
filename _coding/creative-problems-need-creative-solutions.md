opinion: How do you record when your heating goes on and off? You can probably buy
  advanced home heating control systems but what about when you already have a system?
  I have a wireless thermostat but its don't track the history of my usage. Some options
  thought of were, hacking my thermostats API's or wiring something directly to the
  control board. In the end the simplest and easiest solution I found was a wireless
  temperature alert monitor placed in front of the boilers exhaust pipe! A couple
  days in an it works like a charm, alerts be when the heat is on and when it turns
  off. Now all I have to do is figure out how to export the emails to a spreadsheet!
