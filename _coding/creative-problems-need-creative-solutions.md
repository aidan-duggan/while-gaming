opinion: How do you record when your heating goes on and off? You can probably buy
  advanced home heating control systems but what about when you already have a system?
  I can control my heat remotely but its don't track the history of my usage. Some
  complex options like hack the company's API's for my existing system or try to wire
  something directly to the control board. In the end the simplest and easiest solution
  I found was a wireless temperature alert monitor placed in front of the boilers
  exhaust pipe! A couple days in an it works like a charm, alerts be when the heat
  is on and when it turns off. Now all I have to do is figure out how to export the
  emails to a spreadsheet!
