**Whats changed**

The main challenge I faced was how to reflect the position of the players on the pitch during the game. Rugby is a highly positional sport, where players are standing before play starts plays a big part in how the play progresses. Tracking each player feels very simulation and fiddly, rather then the dyanmic high energy game I'd like. I started to form an idea where multiple players positions would be on a cards, and only some cards would be in play at any time. That way not all players have to be tracked, and these cards can be another resource that players have to manage.
